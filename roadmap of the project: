Project Steps:
Set Up the Environment

Initialize the project in your local machine using Node.js or Python (Flask/Django).
Set up the front-end framework (React, Vue, or Angular).
Set up your database (MongoDB or MySQL).
Front-End Development (React as an example)

Create a React project.
Build the Home Page that lists the webtoons using the data from the "Top 10 Popular Webtoons" article.
Build the Webtoon Detail Page, following the structure from the "Lore Olympus" example.
Add user login, registration forms, and set up authentication using JWT.
Back-End Development (Node.js with Express as an example)

Set up a Node.js server using Express.
Create API endpoints for handling webtoon data, user authentication, and user favorites.
Integrate JWT for authentication.
Set up a database schema for webtoons and user favorites in MongoDB or MySQL.
Create APIs to fetch and display webtoon details and store/retrieve user favorites.
User Authentication

Implement user authentication using JWT.
Create login and registration APIs that will store user information in the database.
Protect routes such as favorites to ensure only logged-in users can access them.
Favorites Page

Allow users to mark webtoons as favorites.
Display the list of userâ€™s favorite webtoons by fetching from the database.
Ensure data persists across sessions (using MongoDB or MySQL).
Deployment

Deploy the app on Heroku or AWS.
Set up environment variables securely for API keys and sensitive data.
Make sure the app is publicly accessible and fully functional.
